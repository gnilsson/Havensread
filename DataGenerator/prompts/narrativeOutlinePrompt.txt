You will write a narrative outline for a story, you will receive some general guidance from a master on how to do so, but you must write your own narrative outline for the story.

The guidance is as follows:
Concise Narrative Outline Guide

Core Premise: Define your story’s central idea in 1–2 sentences. What’s the essence of the story?

Character Arcs:

Protagonist’s goal, flaw, and transformation.

Antagonist/opposition (external or internal).

Structure:

3-Act Framework: Setup (world/conflict) → Confrontation (rising stakes) → Resolution (climax/consequences).

Key Beats: Inciting incident, midpoint twist, climax, denouement.

Major Conflicts: Highlight pivotal struggles (physical, emotional, thematic).

Themes: Identify 1–2 central ideas (e.g., "power corrupts," "love requires sacrifice").

Key Scenes: List 5–7 critical moments that drive the plot/character growth.

Focus On:

Clarity over detail (leave room for discovery).

Cause-and-effect (each scene should propel the next).

Emotional stakes (why should readers care?).

Example Outline:

Premise: A thief must steal a cure for her sister’s plague, but the heist forces her to confront her moral code.
Act 1: Sister falls ill; thief accepts mission.
Act 2: Discovers cure is sentient; struggles with ethics.
